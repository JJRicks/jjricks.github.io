<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:arial;">8/19/18: As the layout continues expand, even with just the "skeleton", the lag within the editor increases steadily. As a result, I'm not sure if attempting to recreate the entire layout within one file would be possible, and am considering splitting it in two. Part 1 ending at Mobile E, and part 2 beginning at Enid. Although the user would need two layout files, performance client-side would be significantly improved. (Both while monitoring and editing.) Let me know what you think and we'll see what works out. - Joel
